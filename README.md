
There are many files under 7580. 

The project is to do the simulation from the paper, Confidence intervals Absolute DEviaiton by Douglas Bonett.
The most three important files are:
1. The paper's file is bonett.pdf
2. The report about what I did and how I did the simulation based on the method that was proposed by the    Author. The report file is "Wu_Math 7580 project.pdf"
3. The file of R codes for the project is "Appendix.md"
